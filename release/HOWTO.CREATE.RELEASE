To make a "release", you need a working pihpsdr executable
in your pihpsdr directory. 

Then, simply do "make release". This creates the tar file

pihpsdr-GIT_VERSION.tar

where GIT_VERSION expands to the current git version.

The tar file contains the "pihpsdr" directory inside
the "release" directory, with the pihpsdr executable
added.
