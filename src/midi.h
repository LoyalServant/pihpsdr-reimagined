/*
 * MIDI support for pihpsdr
 *
 * Midi support works in three layers
 *
 * Layer-1: hardware specific
 * --------------------------
 *
 * Layer1 either implements a callback function (if the operating system
 * supports MIDI) or a separate thread polling MIDI data. Whenever a
 * MIDI command arrives, such as Note on/off or Midi-Controller value
 * changed, it calls Layer 2.
 *
 * Layer-2: MIDI device specific
 * -----------------------------
 *
 * Layer2 translates MIDI commands into pihpsdr actions. This is done with
 * a table-driven algorithm, such that the same translator can be used for
 * any MIDI device provided the tables have been set up correctly.
 * It seems overly complicated to create a user interface for setting up
 * these tables, instead a standard text file describing the MIDI device
 * is read and the tables are set up.
 * Layer-2 has SDR applications in mind, but is not necessarily specific
 * to pihpsr. It calls the Layer-3 function.
 *
 * Layer-3: pihpsdr specific
 * -------------------------
 *
 * Layer 3, finally, implements all the "actions" we can make, such as TUNE
 * or VFO. This Layer calls pihpsdr functions.
 *
 * One word to MIDI channels. Usually, a MIDI device can be configured to use
 * a specific channel, such that different keyboards use different channels.
 * The Layer-2 tables can either specify that the MIDI command has to come from
 * a specific channel, or can specify that the action will be taken not matter which
 * channel the MIDI message comes from. The latter case should be the default, but
 * if we want to connect more than one MIDI device, we need to speficy the channel.
 *
 * In principle this supports more than one MIDI device, but in this case they
 * must generate MIDI events on different channels
